<p class="para1">If there is any land on this earth that can lay claim to be the blessed Punya-Bhumi, to be the land to which souls on this earth must come to account for Karma, the land to which every soul that is wending its way Godward must come to attain its last home, the land where humanity has attained its highest towards gentleness, towards generosity, towards purity, towards calmness, above all, the land of introspection and of spirituality -- It is India. It is the same India which has withstood the shocks of centuries, of hundreds of foreign invasions. It is the same land which stands firmer than any rock in the world, with its undying vigour, indestructible life, Its life is of the same nature as the soul, without beginning and without end, immortal; and we are the children of such a country.

<p class="para1">Although Vivekananda was a powerful orator and writer in English and Bengali,he was not a thorough scholar,and most of his published works were compiled from lectures given around the world which were "mainly delivered impromptant and with little preparation".His main work, Raja Yoga, consists of talks he delivered in New York.

<p class="para1">
	Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and one of the most celebrated spiritual leaders of India. He was more than just a spiritual mind; he was a prolific thinker, great orator and passionate patriot. He carried on the free-thinking philosophy of his guru, Ramakrishna Paramhansa forward into a new paradigm. He worked tirelessly towards betterment of the society, in servitude of the poor and needy, dedicating his all for his country. He was responsible for the revival of Hindu spiritualism and established Hinduism as a revered religion on world stage. His message of universal brotherhood and self-awakening remains relevant especially in the current backdrop of widespread political turmoil around the world. The young monk and his teachings have been an inspiration to many, and his words have become goals of self-improvement especially for the youth of the country. For this very reason, his birthday, January 12, is celebrated as the National Youth Day in India.
