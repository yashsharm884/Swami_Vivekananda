<br><br>

<p align="center" class="para1">Swami Vivekananda, known in his pre-monastic life as Narendra Nath Datta, was born in an affluent family in Kolkata on 12 January 1863. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was a successful attorney with interests in a wide range of subjects, and his mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, was endowed with deep devotion, strong character and other qualities. A precocious boy, Narendra excelled in music, gymnastics and studies. By the time he graduated from Calcutta University, he had acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects, especially Western philosophy and history. Born with a yogic temperament, he used to practise meditation even from his boyhood, and was associated with Brahmo Movement for some time.

Our Mission</b> <br>

<br>
<br>
<b>
Man-Making and Nation Building <br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   as its twin objectives, it is to be aimed </b>

<br><br>
(1) Transforming our people's inherent God-wardness into the right spiritual urge rising out of the teachings of the Upanishads, namely,
<br><br>
(a) Each soul is potentially divine
<br><br>
(b) Faith in God, in turn means faith in one's self,

           i.e. in one's potentiality to rise to divine heights.
<br><br>
(2) To convert the spiritual fervour thus released into works of national reconstruction.

Pranava Mantra ||ૐ||

<small>

The goal which all the Vedas declare, which all austerities aim at, and which men desire when they lead the life of continence … is AUM.

<b>Goal</b>
<br><br>


"The goal which all the Vedas declare, which all austerities aim at, and which men desire when they lead the life of continence … is AUM.

This syllable AUM is indeed Brahman. Whosoever knows this syllable obtains all that he desires. This is the best support; this is the highest support. Whosoever knows this support is adored in the world of Brahma."
